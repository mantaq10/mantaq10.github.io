Expertise is fragile and lacks consistency. It is built on a world we know well yet it falters with over-confidence when the world changes. Expertise is a curated effort and experience to build understanding to add value to one’s domain. When things change, our expertise doesn’t automatically update to changing conditions. It remains britlle and worst off, it can be outdated or wrong.

In a static world, expertise is knowing a map of a domain and knowing how to navigate it. Given any topic, the expert is one who knows the underlying concepts, components and their interplay, i.e. the map of the terrain. An expert then navigates the map (the problem space), lays down all known paths (the solution space) and recommends a particular pathway (The solution). Experts are navigators. They know the pathways and have walked these paths many times. Through a combination of training, relentless trial and erorr and accumulated experience they have mastered their craft.

In a changing world, expertise fail when the map no longer represents the terrain. However, terrains change all the time. And experts keep charting better maps all the time. In any case, maps have a built in error rate and an expiry date. Afterall, the map is not the terrain.  Expertise doesn’t just aggregate, it can falter back. Worst, without the expert knowing it. When experts chart out maps of the the terrain, they hold underlying beliefs, assumptions and uphold their personal ego. And this is what gets in their own way. It becomes rather a point of concern when there are real techtonic shifts and the terrains change drastically. Though these happen rarely and gradually and then suddenly. This is where wayfinding is needed besides navigating.

Navigation is exploiting the known, wayfinding is exploring the unknown. Navigation is using Google Maps, wayfinding is being dropped in an uncharted forrest. Navigation rewards efficiency and productivity. Wayfinding relies upon resilience and sustainability. Drop a London cabbie in a random forrest and see them wiggle. Expertise requires both strategies. However, wayfinding requries taking a few steps back to progress forward.

I like the principle of ‘strong beliefs, held loosely’. When we are enroute of becoming an expert, we inherit the maps from our predecessors. This is the set of beliefs and presuppositions that when not stress tested make us brittle to underlying changing terrains. A strong belief is one you didn’t just lazily inhereited from others but rather you have clarity and conviction over it. You can articulate why you belief so yourself and not just take it for granted as a social norm. Holding strong beliefs loosely indicates taking the belief as a hypothesis rather as a fact. After all, these are merely opinions we carry and allowing them to be challengeable and updatable charts relevant maps. There is also a sunk cost fallacy of letting go of our assumptions and beliefs especially when they were helping navigate well in the past.

A navigator has traversed the map enough to dismiss any alternate routes they previously rejected. When the terrain changes, those dismissed routes may become viable options again. The navigator may not acknowledge this change. They may feel at a personal loss of authority or perhaps its a sunk cost fallacy. Confronting one’s ego is quite challenging. Its easy to intellectualise and feel morally righteous about it. However, when egos collide, their fixed mindsets become detrimental.

I have an hypothesis: Dumb questions are labelled dumb because they are taken for granted and are assumed to be so. For many, asking dumb questions provokes social anxiety. One may feel risking their reputation and their persona. I find that dumb questions as tools for clarity seeking. The answer may be obvious to others but now I’d be better informed as well. Better yet, the answers may trigger a discussion that benefits shared understanding on the problem space. It also provides some resilience against building the wrong solution. The downside is one may appear as an idiot, until one are not anymore.

While an expert may not like to be a beginner, one can nevertheless adopt a beginner’s mindset. Asking which of our assumptions don’t hold true? Also being articulate about what evidence, information or reasoning will change our beliefs? This is bayesian inferencing. We start with prior beliefs. As new information comes through, we update our priors with the new information. The posterior beliefs are incremental in nature and thus helps one course correct. Let go of some of the fixed routes to allow for playful and curious exploration. Slowing down yet looking up with fresh new eyes. Vuja De!
