### Why
- Wanted a beginner friendly tool for a kind environment
- Already some traction in ruby to get started and learn bundler.io
- Getting my toolchain created again
- went for boring (stable) tech with conventions over configuration
- has a learning ladder. 
- security focused
- SSGs as a starting point for web development

- ### learnings
#### Decision choices and tradeoffs
- liquid templating over go templating
- bundler and rubygems
- kind - increasing complexity. 
- extensibility is great in jekyll
- build time argument is vanity and they have been working on improving it v4 onwards. 

### delights
- Tom Preston-Werner wrote it. 
- CO-Founder of Github
- Frontmatter idea
- Ruby glory days
