Its time to let go of your expertise. Sooner or later you will experience friction between what you know with how the world is now operating. It is changing more unpredictably than you are able to progress consistently. You curated a set of ideas and operated with confidence because it gave you a sense of understanding and being valued. What happens when the rules of the game change, your underlying beliefs and assumptions may not hold true anymore. You may believe that you hold on evergreen principles that withstand any drastic changes in the world. Unfortunately, your ideas and beliefs can imprison your mind. What you know anchors you down to a limited space of the known known. 

There aren’t many original thoughts and our thinking is shaped by our priors: Nature, Nurture and Neighbourhood. The environment and the people around you created the initial seeds of thought in you. You are a subject of cultural programming that forms your prior set of beliefs that get hardened over life unless examined deliberately. The role of your parents way of thinking and their world view has the greatest influence on you. That’s why people who were born into certain cultural identities, religious beliefs and ways of living carry the same idea memes and habits. And then the cycle repeats when you pass on these to the next generation. This applies to your individual self as well. You are what you repeatedly do. Your habits solidify the narratives in your mind, as our brains function with cognitive biases. 

Part of your conformism of thinking is allegiance to your tribe, you are hardwired to seek belonging. And this tragically limits the whole tribe from adapting or improving the collective condition of the tribe. The narratives on social norms are conventions that in theory all agreed to subscribe to, yet without questioning our own beliefs and discovering our underlying assumptions, these conventions are not relevant anymore, infact they are brittle and can damage us. Yet we hold them without questioning them. It seems there is just too much at stake to let go. And so our default mode is to take them for granted. 

There is comfort in inheriting our set of beliefs and ideas, after all, they have been in practice for ages so you can mistakenly assume them to be correct. Even when they were serving a particular time and place, the context keeps changing. More so, we can’t re-examine all of our beliefs and ideas for it will handicap us from operating in the world. And so we (lazily) leverage on the collective wisdom of others. The point is that without contemplating on them, we deny ourselves the opportunity to flourish and fall in the trap of collective evil where we become merely a frog in boiling water.  

Also, extracting the unconscious is a life’s mission, we are bound to what our conscious mind informs us, and it is quite limited. Our beliefs are inherited priors with some adjustments over time, though without deliberation. What happens when you change your neighbourhood or more broadly the (unspoken) rules and norms of the world change? Familiarity is fragile. What happen when your beliefs and assumptions are challenged? Your ego fights back with conviction of your competence. This is the unconscious that drives us in disguise. 


> Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given to you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer. - *Rainer Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet*

### Conflicting Ideas


### Anchor Context
- [ ] I found myself settled in a somwhat 'optimised' life yet had these thoughts and fears of a changing world knocking at the doors, ready to rock my world.  there was an inner itch to  though there was a yearning to get back to the drawing board, a call to adventure to adopt a beginner's mind and practice playfulness. So, I minimised my belongings, quit my corporate job and took off on an adventure.

- [ ] I've been backpacking since October. I attended a few events out of my circle of competence and community and did a 10 day Vipassana meditation for the first time.  I set out with a few guiding heuristics. The first one that I will expose myself to unfamiliar environments and challenges. Pushing myself into new environments made me experience what being a beginner feels like that I didn't see just by intellectualising it. Its a humbling yet empowering experience. Like many of us, I too was ruminating while in an established corporate job with inner conflicts piling on what creative work I'd like to pursue next as AI offers both opportunities and disruptions, while our corporate operating models are by and large the same, even with AI 'sprinkled' over.

> A beginner's mind is an attitude of letting go of one's ego, expertise and presumptions. It is a state of awareness of our limited knowledge and an opportunity to expand it by letting it go. *"In the Beginner’s Mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are only few" Suzuki Roshi, "Zen Mind, Beginner Mind"*.

### Unblocking the Self


In AI and optimisation terms, no matter what efficiencies you strive for, they are local optima, they are focusing on climbing the hill though may miss out on choosing the right hill (highest peak) to begin with. Our beliefs and narratives need a bit of shaking to remain resilient and adaptive to uncertainty.
